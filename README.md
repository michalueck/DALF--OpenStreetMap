# DALF--OpenStreetMap
openstreetmap project for Udacity Nano Degree
I decided first to take Elgin Texas in the United States of America as dear friends are living there and one day I want to visit them. But I found out that the source data is only 10MB large. So I had to find an alternative and decided to take Neuruppin in Germany, where I spent some time when I met my husband and programmed a database for the firefighter station. The Neuruppin OSM file is 150 MB big.

For the review I prepared a sample osm.
