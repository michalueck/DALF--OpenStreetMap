# DALF--OpenStreetMap
openstreetmap project for Udacity Nano Degree
This project is about dealing with osm data, downloading a file from openstreet map and wrangle the data:
check the content of the map, audit street names and clean them as well as postal code and phone numbers. The data set turned out to be very tidy. Next step was about to query the data with SQL. For the code snippets please refer to the .py files. The final report is the html.
